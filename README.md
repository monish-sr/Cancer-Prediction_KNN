# Cancer Prediction
This project aims to predict the type of cancer for a patient using machine learning.

# Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer as Benign or Malignant using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical data, scaled for consistency, and split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

The goal is to provide a simple, scalable approach to cancer diagnosis prediction, demonstrating the use of basic ML techniques with Python and scikit-learn.
