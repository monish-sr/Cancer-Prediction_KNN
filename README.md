# Cancer Prediction
This project aims to predict the type of cancer for a patient using machine learning.

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning pipeline to classify breast cancer as Benign or Malignant using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical data, scaled for consistency, and split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance. The goal is to provide a simple, scalable approach to cancer diagnosis prediction, demonstrating the use of basic ML techniques with Python and scikit-learn.

##Dataset
This project utilizes the Cancer dataset, which includes patient(s)'s cancer related intel. This dataset contains 569 rows and 33 columns.

## Execution Plan

The methodology outlines the step-by-step process followed to design, train, evaluate, and deploy the machine learning model for predicting breast cancer as either Benign or Malignant. The pipeline ensures data integrity, scalability, and efficient learning using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm.
